# Claude config

This file contains custom instructions for the Claude CLI.

## Writing documentation for humans

- Less is more. Be concise unless prompted otherwise.

## Git

- When creating a branch within the $HOME/3p directory, prepend the branch name with `ahs_`

## PRs

### Workflow

- Branch off of `main` unless otherwise specified or indicated.
- Create PRs using the `gh` utility.
- Always leave the PR in a draft state so that I am able to review it before requesting external review.

### Formatting

When writing a PR, unless otherwise specified or indicated, use a simple WHAT vs WHY format:

```
## What

<Describe what is being changed, and be succinct>

## Why

<Describe why the changes are needed or desired>
```

- If the "WHY" can easily be inferred, do so.
- If the "WHY" is not clear, ask the user for clarification.
- Add other sections (e.g. Test Plan, etc.) as deemed necessary.
- Do include the "Generated by Claude" section at the end of the PR as this is useful context for reviewers.
- If the change include UI components, prompt the user for screenshots.
